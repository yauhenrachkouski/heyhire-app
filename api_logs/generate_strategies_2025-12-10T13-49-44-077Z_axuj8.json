  "reasoning": {
    "market_understanding": "Miami is a regional market with a moderate pool of tech talent. While it is not as large as tech hubs like San Francisco or New York, it still has a significant number of professionals in the software engineering field. The role of a Software Engineer is quite common, but the requirement for expertise in Next.js makes it more specialized. The market size for software engineers with Next.js experience in Miami is likely to be in the range of a few thousand professionals. Given the growing popularity of Next.js for modern web development, there is moderate competition for candidates with this skill set, especially in a desirable location like Miami.",
    "criteria_analysis": "The original job description is focused on finding a Software Engineer in Miami with expertise in Next.js. The user has marked Next.js as a high-importance criterion, indicating it is a must-have skill for this role. The location is specified as Miami, which will be used as a primary filter. The title 'Software Engineer' is broad, so it will be used as a base for the search. There are no medium or low importance criteria provided, which simplifies the search strategy. The user's emphasis on Next.js suggests that candidates must have strong proficiency in this framework, while the location and title are more flexible.",
    "strategy_plan": "Given the specificity of the role and the high importance of Next.js, I will create 5 strategies. Strategy 1 will be a baseline search using the title 'Software Engineer' and location 'Miami' to gauge the overall market size. Strategy 2 will focus on candidates with Next.js experience, using an AND logic to ensure this skill is present. Strategy 3 will explore alternative titles such as 'Frontend Developer' or 'Web Developer' to capture candidates who may not have the exact title but possess the required skills. Strategy 4 will include a broader search for candidates with Next.js experience across Florida to increase the candidate pool. Strategy 5 will focus on candidates with a history of working with modern JavaScript frameworks, which may include Next.js, to identify potential candidates who can quickly adapt. This mix ensures a comprehensive search that balances specificity with breadth, aiming to yield around 500 quality candidates.",
    "boolean_approach": "For the title string, I will use 'Software Engineer' as the primary title. In variation strategies, I will include 'Frontend Developer' and 'Web Developer' to capture a wider range of candidates. The skill combination will focus on 'Next.js' using AND logic in core strategies to ensure candidates have this expertise. I will exclude roles like 'Recruiter', 'HR', and 'Talent Acquisition' to avoid irrelevant profiles. The searchQuery will be crafted to stay under 300 characters, ensuring it is concise yet effective. Locations will be set to 'Miami' for most strategies, with one strategy expanding to 'Florida' to increase reach."
